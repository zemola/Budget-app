# Budget App

### About the project

> The Budget app keeps track of all your Budget, categories, and expenses. It will allow you to save categories, keep track of what you have, create categories, and generate a categories list based on what you have expenses and what you want to add in your expenses. Also, Budget tracking will allow us to know how much we can plan for the month or year and knows exactly the expences.
